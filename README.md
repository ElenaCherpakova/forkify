# Forkify
## Description
Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data.


## Usage

The Forkify Recipe App allows users to search for recipes.

Users can view the recipe along with the cook time and also increase or decrease the amount of servings they need.

Bookmarked recipes are stored in local storage so no database was required for this application.

## Developer Features
- Uses MVC architecture
- Uses Parcel for bundling
- Uses Axios for HTTP requests
- Uses ES6 modules

## Prerequisites

Start with the latest version of NPM to avoid any errors:

``` npm install npm@latest -g ```
